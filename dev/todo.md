how to take rounding of reported mean and SD into account?

tides_single and tides_multi currently calculate a standardized SD based on the the max SD for that mean, but not for the max for any mean on the scale, which would be more useful for plotting. add this and then update plot multi.

height of lower shaded region in plot multi looks too high to me, check it.
